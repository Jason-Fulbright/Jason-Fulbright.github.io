          <h3>Community Leader</h3>
          <p>2014 - 2015</p>
            <p>I was one of the 12 male community leaders at ASMSA; this position is similar to a resident advisor in college. I spent a minimum of 6 hours each week helping around the school. However, some weekends the community leaders are required to stay and host prospective students and give families tours around the school.</p>

            <p>I have officially played rugby now for 3 years for the Little Rock Stormers. However, I grew up around the sport because my Dad has played since he was in college. Played fullback for 3 years; devoted 12-15  hours per week to practice, conditioning, and games.</p>

            <p>I participated in the ISEF national science fair competition. It is a yearlong research and experimentation process with it concluding with a presentation to judges. My project is over the effects of citric acid alone and in combination with copper on E.coli. This experiment took an average of 6 hours a week in the lab.</p>
