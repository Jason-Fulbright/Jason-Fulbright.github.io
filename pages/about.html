    <p>Jason was born in Little Rock, Arkansas and grew up on his family farm in the small town of Malvern, Arkansas. Here he attended <a href="http://www.bismarcklions.net/">Bismarck High School</a> until he was 17. He then attened a college preparatory school, the <a href="http://www.asmsa.org/">Arkansas School for Mathematics, Sciences, and the Arts</a>, where he began taking photography classes and fell in love with photography. Now Jason aspires to be an underwater photographer to bring awareness to the beauty of the oceans, and why we should protect that beauty for our future generations. Jason is concerned about topics such as the loss of coral reefs, and that is why he is majoring in journalism with a minor in marine policy. Jason currently lives in Miami, Florida where he attends school at the <a href="http://welcome.miami.edu/">University of Miami</a>.</p>
